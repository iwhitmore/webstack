Some of the technologies in the current stack are:

* React with a PureRender base class
* Redux with react bindings and reselect
* Superagent, Falcor, PouchDB, and SocketIO
* Gulp, Browserify, and Babel for building ES6
* Mocha, Chai, Sinon, and Istanbul for testing and coverage

Other technologies at [Planfu](http://planfu.com) that will be integrated into this project sometime in the future:

* Flowtype
* Radium
